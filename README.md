## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, you will need a server to serve the resources of your game. You can try using LiveServer, which is an extension for Visual Studio Code, or any other server of your choice. For more information, refer to the [Phaser Getting Started](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3) guide.

## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

- `assets/` - Contains the static assets used by the game.
- `src/` - Contains the game source code.
- `src/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `src/main.js` - The main entry point. This contains the game configuration and starts the game.
- `index.html` - A basic HTML page to contain the game.
- `style.css` - Some simple CSS rules to help with page layout.

## Deploying to Production

In order to deploy your game, you will need to upload *all* the content of the folder to a public facing web server.
